<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<hr/>

<p>This application is designed to create a shopping list, in it you can mark the collected goods and also indicate their price and the application will calculate the total amount of the collected goods (<strong>the price of the goods is indicated and calculated without reference to the currency</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>The UI was designed for mobile devices and has 2 themes: light and dark.</strong></p>

<p><h3>How it works</h3></p>
<hr/>

<p>To add new list item you just need input it's name in the field and press <strong>"Enter"</strong> button.</p>
<br/>
<div align="center">

</div>
<br/>
<p>After that you can change its state, for example mark it as collected or set a price.</p>
<p>You can set a price through input field that lead after item name end it will apply immediately or by click on item itself and set or change price in pop-up window as shown on second screenshot. You can also delete one specific item or all list by press <strong>"Delete"</strong> or <strong>"Delete all"</strong> button.</p>

<p><h3>Additionally</h3></p>
<hr/>

<p>This is my first project on React, during the development of which I became familiar with its basic concepts and functions such as: <strong>React component, React element, useState, useEffect, useContext</strong>.</p>

<p><h3>Getting Started</h3></p>
<hr/>

<p>This project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a>.</p>

<p><h4>Available Scripts</h4></p>

<p>In the project directory, you can run:</p>

<p><h4><code>npm start</code></h4></p>

<p>Runs the app in the development mode.</p>
<p>Open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to view it in your browser.</p>

<p>The page will reload when you make changes.</p>
<p>You may also see any lint errors in the console.</p>

<p><h4><code>npm test</code></h4></p>

<p>Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.</p>
<p>See the section about <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests">running tests</a> for more information.</p>

<p><h4><code>npm run build</code></h4></p>

<p>Builds the app for production to the <code>build</code> folder.</p>
<p>It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.</p>

<p>The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.</p>
<p>Your app is ready to be deployed!</p>

<p>See the section about <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment">deployment</a> for more information.</p>

<p><h4><code>npm run eject</code></h4></p>

<p><strong>Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you <code>eject</code>, you can't go back!</strong></p>

<p>If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can <code>eject</code> at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.</p>

<p>Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except <code>eject</code> will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.</p>

<p>You don't have to ever use <code>eject</code>. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.</p>
